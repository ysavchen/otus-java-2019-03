GC ranking for Throughput (more working time -> less throughput):
1. SerialGC
2. Shenandoah
3. ParallelGC
4. G1

GC ranking for Latency (5 second log):
1. Shenandoah
3. ParallelGC
4. SerialGC
4. G1

- concurrent GC has always higher CPU and memory usage, than a single-threaded one
- more heap size, better throughput results for GC
- no sense to use a concurrent GC on small heaps (in my load 2g and less)
- SerialGC goes more often on small heap (in my load 2g and less) with less pause-time
- Shenandoah has the lowest footprint among concurrent GC
- G1 has the highest footprint among concurrent GC
